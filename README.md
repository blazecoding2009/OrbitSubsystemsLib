Orbit Subsystems repository

A collection of generic subsystem code to speed up development early in the year by having prepared versions of common types of subsystems

Currently available subsystems:
- Flywheels
- Intake
  - Intake stop switch
- Pivot
- Telescope
- LEDs

Planned features:
- Intake and flywheel linear speed control
- AdvantageKit integration
- Asymmetric trapezoidal motion profiles
- S-curve motion profiles
- Inverse kinematics for chained pivots and telescopes
- Simulation support
  - Physics/kinematics perhaps?
